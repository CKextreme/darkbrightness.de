# GoHugo's Lookup Order

## Lookup Rules

## Lookup with Theme
"In Hugo, layouts can live in either the projectâ€™s or the themes' layout folders,
and the most specific layout will be chosen.
Hugo will interleave the lookups listed below,
finding the most specific one either in the project or themes."
